   ```javascript
   // Open: backend/fix_and_calculate_interest.js
   // Line 6: Change this to your actual gazette date
   const GAZETTE_DATE = '2024-01-15'; // ← CHANGE THIS!
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   node fix_and_calculate_interest.js
   ```

3. **Refresh your report** - Interest values will appear immediately!

### **Option 2: Use Your Application's UI** 🖥️

If your application has a "Calculate Interest" feature:

1. Go to the compensation payment details page
2. For each owner, click "Calculate Interest" button
3. Enter:
   - Gazette Date (e.g., 2024-01-15)
   - Compensation Amount
   - Interest Rate (7%)
4. Save
5. Refresh report

---

### **Option 3: Use API Endpoint** 🔌

Call the interest calculation API for each owner:

```http
POST /api/compensation/plans/:plan_id/lots/:lot_id/owners/:owner_nic/calculate-interest

Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "compensation_amount": 1000000,
  "valuation_date": "2024-01-15",
  "interest_rate": 0.07
}
```

**Example for Nadeesha Fernando:**
```http
POST /api/compensation/plans/8039/lots/1/owners/198934567890/calculate-interest

Body:
{
  "compensation_amount": 1000000,
  "valuation_date": "2024-01-15",
  "interest_rate": 0.07
}
```

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Gazette Date is Required**
   - Interest calculation starts from gazette publication date
   - Cannot calculate without this date

2. **Interest to be Paid** = `calculated_interest_amount`
   - Stored in database after calculation
   - Represents total accrued interest

3. **Interest Paid** = Sum of all interest payments
   - `interest_full_payment_paid_amount`
   - `interest_part_payment_01_paid_amount`  
   - `interest_part_payment_02_paid_amount`
   - Currently Rs. 0 because no payments made yet

4. **Real-time = Always Current**
   - Every report request queries database directly
   - No caching or static values
   - Values update immediately after any change

---

## ✅ CONFIRMATION

Your system architecture is **100% correct** for real-time data:

```sql
-- This is what runs when you generate a report:
SELECT 
  COALESCE(cpd.calculated_interest_amount, 0) as interest_7_percent,  -- Interest to be Paid
  COALESCE(
    cpd.interest_full_payment_paid_amount +
    cpd.interest_part_payment_01_paid_amount +
    cpd.interest_part_payment_02_paid_amount, 0
  ) as interest_paid  -- Interest Paid
FROM compensation_payment_details cpd
WHERE cpd.plan_id = ? AND cpd.lot_id = ?
```

**This query runs fresh every time = Real-time data!**

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ **Confirmed:** Real-time data flow is working
2. 🔧 **Action Required:** Set gazette date & calculate interest
3. 📊 **Result:** Interest values will appear in reports automatically

**Choose Option 1 above for the fastest solution!**
