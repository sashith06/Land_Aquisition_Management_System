// Test file to verify Financial Officer access control for compensation details
// This file demonstrates the role-based access control implementation

/*
ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:

1. Frontend Protection:
   - CompensationDetailsTab.jsx and CompensationDetails.jsx check user roles
   - Only 'financial_officer', 'Financial Officer', or 'FO' roles can edit
   - Visual feedback with lock icons and disabled buttons for unauthorized users
   - Alert messages for unauthorized access attempts
   - Proper error handling for 403/401 responses from backend

2. Backend Protection:
   - CompensationController.js validates user role before allowing modifications
   - Returns 403 error for non-Financial Officer users
   - Uses authMiddleware.js requireFinancialOfficer middleware in routes

3. Routes Protection:
   - compensationRoutes.js uses requireFinancialOfficer middleware
   - Only authenticated Financial Officers can access POST endpoints

4. Visual Indicators:
   - Yellow warning banners for non-authorized users
   - Lock icons on buttons and UI elements
   - Disabled form controls with visual feedback
   - Tooltip messages explaining access restrictions

5. Role Detection:
   - Prioritizes authenticated user role from JWT token
   - Falls back to route-based role detection
   - Consistent role checking across components

6. Error Handling:
   - Specific error messages for 403 (Access Denied) responses
   - Graceful fallback to localStorage for offline scenarios
   - User-friendly error notifications

TESTING CHECKLIST:
□ Login as Financial Officer - should be able to edit compensation
□ Login as Project Engineer - should see view-only mode
□ Login as Chief Engineer - should see view-only mode  
□ Login as Land Officer - should see view-only mode
□ Test network failure scenarios
□ Test token expiration scenarios
□ Verify backend API returns 403 for unauthorized users
□ Check that visual indicators (lock icons, banners) appear correctly
